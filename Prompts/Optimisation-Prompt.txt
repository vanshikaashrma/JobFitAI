- Quantifying achievements where applicable (e.g., improved model accuracy by X%).
- Including AI-specific keywords like deep learning, neural networks, and data-driven solutions.
- Tailoring the content to reflect leadership in AI projects, as well as problem-solving skills in real-world AI applications.
- Ensuring the resume is ATS-friendly by using relevant terms and maintaining a clear, concise format.
